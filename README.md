# ArQmA Burn Wallet Generator

The addresses generated by this program are used to burn coins.

Any amount send to these addresses will not be recoverable.

The RNG seed is manually set to reproduce the address generation.

The addresses are generated by brute forcing the PUBLIC spend and view keys.

The keys are validated by the function ge_frombytes_vartime from core and the function crypto_core_ed25519_is_valid_point from libsodium to check if EC point are valid.
